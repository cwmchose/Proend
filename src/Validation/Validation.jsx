        Species-Specific HbYX Protein Characterization and Functional Validation
      </h1>
      <p>
        Our research extends beyond the identification and prediction of HbYX
        motif-containing proteins to include the characterization of
        species-specific variants and their functional roles across different
        organisms. We are currently working in a full species screening of all
        the HbYX proteins to understand their binding capabilities and validate
        their functions through targeted degradation assays.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our efforts in characterizing these proteins and validating their
        functions underscore the potential of species-specific HbYX proteins as
        novel targets for therapeutic intervention and as tools for exploring
        the evolutionary diversity of proteasome regulation. This research not
        only validates the predictions made by ProEnd but also illuminates the
        complex regulatory networks that govern protein degradation,
        highlighting the importance of HbYX proteins in maintaining cellular
        homeostasis.
